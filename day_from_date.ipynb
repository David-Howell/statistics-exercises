    "\n",
    "**The Year Code\n",
    "To calculate the Year Code, use this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(YY + (YY div 4)) mod 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "YY is the last two digits of the year. For the year `1897`, it’s `97`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, divide `YY` by `4` and discard the remainder: `97 / 4 = 24`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then add `24` back into the `YY` number, which is `97` in this case, resulting in `121`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is: `121 mod 7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**”Mod” means to divide the number and keep only the remainder. `For 121 mod 7`, start removing sevens:\n",
    "\n",
    "`10 x 7` is `70`, leaving us with `51`, because `121 - 70 = 51`.\n",
    "`7 x 7 = 49`, and `51 - 49 = 2`.\n",
    "We’ve removed all the sevens from `121` until we are left with a remainder of `2`. That is the `Year Code` for `1897`.\n",

    "If you don't know how to memorize a number like 033614625035, you could either use repetition or learn a mnemonic system like the Major System or Dominic System. I use my Ben System images: Samwise (033) throws a glass of beer (614) on George Boole (625) who falls backwards on Sally (035).\n",
    "A way to quickly memorize 033614625035 without a complex mnemonic system would be to use a number shape system to associate images with each month. For example, you could picture a game of soccer (football) in January, with ball being a mnemonic image for zero. You could picture a butterfly in February and March, if you use a butterfly image for the number three. If the number six is represented by the image of an elephant, picture an elephant in April and July, and so on. If you are having trouble associating the images with the months, pick an aspect of each month to associate the image with. For example, Halloween is in October, so to remember that October has a Month Code of zero (represented by an image of a ball), you could picture a group of people in Halloween costumes doing something with a ball. That would link the month of October with the number zero."
